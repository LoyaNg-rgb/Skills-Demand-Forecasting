# Skills-Demand-Forecasting

A comprehensive machine learning project for forecasting retail sales using time series analysis and ensemble methods.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project implements multiple forecasting models to predict retail sales across different stores and items. The solution includes extensive exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model comparison to identify the best performing approach.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Multi-model approach**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and SARIMA
- **Advanced feature engineering**: Lag features, rolling statistics, and cyclical encoding
- **Time series validation**: Proper temporal splitting for reliable evaluation
- **Comprehensive analysis**: EDA, residual analysis, and error breakdown
- **Interactive visualizations**: Multiple charts for data insights and model performance

## 📈 Results Summary

- **Best Model**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Performance**: RMSE improvement of ~X% over baseline Linear Regression
- **Key Insights**: Lag features and rolling statistics are the most important predictors

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip or conda package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-forecasting.git
cd sales-forecasting
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. **Add your data**: Place your `train.csv` file in the `data/` directory

2. **Run the main analysis**:
```bash
python src/sales_forecast.py
```

3. **Explore notebooks**: Open Jupyter notebooks for interactive analysis:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/01_EDA.ipynb
```

## 📊 Data Requirements

The dataset should contain the following columns:
- `date`: Date column (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `store`: Store identifier
- `item`: Item identifier  
- `sales`: Sales values (target variable)

## 🔧 Models Implemented

### 1. Linear Regression (Baseline)
- Simple linear model for establishing baseline performance
- Fast training and interpretable coefficients

### 2. Random Forest Regressor
- Ensemble method capturing non-linear relationships
- Feature importance analysis included
- Best performing model in this implementation

### 3. SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- Traditional time series forecasting method
- Handles seasonality and trends
- Applied to aggregated daily sales

## 📋 Feature Engineering

The project implements several advanced feature engineering techniques:

- **Temporal features**: Year, month, day, day of week, quarter
- **Cyclical encoding**: Sin/cos transformations for cyclical patterns
- **Lag features**: Previous sales values (1, 7, 14, 30 days)
- **Rolling statistics**: Moving averages and standard deviations
- **Weekend indicators**: Binary features for weekend identification

## 📈 Model Evaluation

Models are evaluated using:
- **RMSE** (Root Mean Square Error)
- **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error) 
- **MAPE** (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
- **Time series cross-validation** for robust assessment

## 🎨 Visualizations

The project generates multiple visualizations:
- Time series plots of sales trends
- Sales distribution by store and item
- Seasonal pattern analysis
- Feature importance rankings
- Residual analysis plots
- Model comparison charts

## 🔍 Key Insights

1. **Feature Importance**: Lag features and rolling statistics are most predictive
2. **Seasonality**: Clear weekly and monthly patterns in sales data
3. **Store Variations**: Some stores are consistently harder to predict
4. **Model Performance**: Random Forest significantly outperforms linear baseline

## 🚧 Future Improvements

- [ ] Integration of external data (holidays, weather, promotions)
- [ ] Advanced models (XGBoost, LightGBM, Neural Networks)
- [ ] Hierarchical forecasting approach
- [ ] Real-time prediction pipeline
- [ ] A/B testing framework for model deployment
